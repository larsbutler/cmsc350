Files included:
    HW1.java - Interactive text/shell UI for exercising GenericArray functions
    GenericArray.java - Core code for the assignment
    GenericArrayTest.hava - Unit tests for GenericArray
    Testable.java - Lightweight unit testing library class

    HW1.txt - This file

To aid me in developing GenericArray.java, I've written
some basic unittest code (GenericArrayTest.java) using an extremely lightweight
unit testing utility class I wrote from scratch (Testable.java).

I added a bit more functionality to GenericArray than was required for the
assignment, including the `size()` and `getArray()` methods. These were
helpful for testing; I hope that's not an issue.

I didn't really know what _exactly_ to include for the test report, so I've
included screenshorts PDF format. Please let me know if there's anything you'd
like me to do differently on the next assignments.

To run the interactive program:

$ javac HW1.java
$ java HW1

Help text will be displayed to show you how to use it.

To run the test code and see a summarized test report:

$ javac GenericArrayTest.java
$ java GenericArrayTest

The test output should look like this:

testGet_empty: pass
testGet_typical: pass
testSet_empty: pass
testSet_typical: pass
testAdd_typical: pass
testAdd_full: pass
testIsFull: pass
testRemove_failures: pass
testRemove_success: pass
testInsert_empty_array: pass
testInsert_nonempty_array: pass
testReverse: pass
12/12 tests ran successfully (failed: 0)

I apologize for the messiness of HW1.java; I kind of ran out of time for this
week and I needed to get this last piece done fast. Hopefully, if I can reuse
the code for the next assignment, it will be a bit cleaner and have better
docs. I also didn't know exactly what you were expected for the UI code, so I
just kind of made it up as I went along. Again, if you would like to see
something different next time, please let me know.

Thanks,
-Lars
